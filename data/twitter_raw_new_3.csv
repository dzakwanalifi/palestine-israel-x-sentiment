But the international community constantly debunks false claims and stats from Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Pro-Palestine sentiments. While at the same time finding credible source claims to the atrocities committed against Israel.  In the past, I have tried to argue both sides to understand if peace is achievable.  Per international law. The attack Hamas set on Israel would be deemed an aggressor event that targeted civilians and was done with major acts against humanity. Per the world’s conventions, Israel can go as far as laying claim to land annexed as a result of taking the defensive measures they are now.  The only malpractice I have seen backed up that would be against standard for Israel is when they shut off the water line to Gaza.   Palestine has been weakening their claims with the International community by supporting or defending the actions of Hamas and rebuke the response from Israel. It is a valid response.  We around the world want to see peace and hate to see civilian casualties.

It was the greatest blessing of his life.  Born Attallah Amash in 1940, my dad had an extremely difficult childhood. He was a victim of war, expelled from his home at just eight years old in 1948, moving from place to place to find shelter and living off scraps.  He never had new clothes except what was provided to him through charity. In the few years (on and off) that he was able to attend school, the other children didn’t want to associate with him. He couldn’t even play soccer with them because he didn’t have shoes.  His father made him sell coffee and tea as a young boy just to make a few cents that his dad would take. The first time my dad had a decent meal was when a family member died (an uncle, who lived and died in a dog house) and neighbors delivered food in his memory.  Even before the conflict, my dad’s family lived in abject poverty. His grandma, grandpa, aunt, and uncle died of starvation under Ottoman rule. They lived in horrendous conditions among rats. They were abused, uneducated, prone to superstitions, and struggled with mental illness.  The Amash family’s misfortune turned into triumph when Rev. & Mrs. Ralph Wagoner (pictured right), of the Muskegon Church of the Brethren, made the sacrifice to sponsor them to come to the United States. The incredible generosity of the Wagoners gave new life to the Amashes.  I’m forever grateful to the Wagoners for making my life in America possible. I’m forever grateful to America for opening its arms to poor refugees like my dad’s family.  This story is why I so dearly love our Constitution, which defends life, liberty, and property. It’s why I wanted to serve in Congress: to support, with my voice and votes, the great principles that define America.

Classic denial can't hand real truths. Gaza was given to Palestine and proposed a two state solution in 2004/5, what was it used for? Terrorism. Elections like the Palestinian Authority (who are not Democractic in the least, never hold elections) pays martyrs for suicide bombings. Let's be real, Nelson was right. Gaza will be flattened, it's necessary to create a demilitarized zone and the blood of many people will be on the PA, Hamas, and yes to some extent Israel too - out of necessity. Open air prison? I think not when the economy exceeds that of some of America's states, yet we manage to build and maintain/develop. You quote U.N. resolutions like a broken record. Nobody cares. Literally, no free Democratic nation in the world will ever accept what happened this week and all hell is going to break loose to ensure this never happens again. Palestine has never existed on a map, ever. Fact. It was written about is tales. And at this rate, never will. I was very much pro two-state solution and now all this has done is set the possibility of that back multiple generations in my point of view, so I hope you're happy about that fact. Trying to belittle Indigenous American's plights as if we weren't literally raped, murdered, and having all our land taken.
