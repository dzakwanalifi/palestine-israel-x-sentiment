It certainly doesn\'t capture mine.  I have a lot to say. I‚Äôve spent the last 72 hours writing, texting, and talking to Israelis, Jews, Muslims, and Palestinians. Much of my reaction is going to piss off people on ""both sides,"" but I am exhausted and hurting and I do not think there is any way to discuss this situation without being radically honest about my views. So I\'m going to try to say what I believe to be true the best I can.  Let me start with this: It could have been me.  That\'s a hard thought to shake when watching the videos out of Israel ‚Äî the concert goers fleeing across an empty expanse, the hostages being paraded through the streets, the people shot in the head at bus stops or in their cars. I went to those parties in the desert, I rubbed shoulders with Israelis and Arabs and Jews and Muslims, I could have easily accepted an invitation to some concert near Sderot and gone without a care, only to be indiscriminately slaughtered. Or, perhaps worse, taken hostage and tortured.  I don‚Äôt believe Hamas is killing Israelis to liberate themselves, nor do I believe they are doing it to make peace. They\'re doing this because they represent the devil on the shoulder of every oppressed Palestinian who has lost someone in this conflict. They\'re doing it because they want vengeance. They are evening the score, and acting on the worst of our human impulses, to respond to blood with blood ‚Äî an inclination that is easy to give in to after what their people have endured. It should not be hard to understand their logic ‚Äî it is only hard to accept that humans are capable of being driven to this. Not defending Hamas is a very low bar to clear. Please clear it.  It‚Äôs not possible to recap the entire 5,000 year history of people fighting over this strip of land in one newsletter. There are plenty of easily accessible places you can learn about it if you want to (and, by the way, many of you should ‚Äî far too many people speak on this issue with an obscene amount of ignorance, loads of arrogance, and a narrow historical lens focused on the last few decades). But I\'ll briefly highlight a few things that are important to me.  In my opinion, the Jewish people have a legitimate historical claim to the land of Israel. Jews had already been expelled and returned and expelled again a half dozen times before the rise of the Muslim and Arab rule of the Ottoman Empire. Of course it‚Äôs messy because we Jews and Arabs and Muslims are all cousins and descendents of the same Canaanites. But Arabs won the land centuries ago the same way Israel and Jews won it in the 20th century: Through conflict and war. The British defeated the Ottoman Empire and then came the Balfour Declaration, which amounted to the British granting the area to the Jewish people, a promise they‚Äôd later try to renege on ‚Äî all before the wars that have defined the region since 1948.  That historical moment in the late 1940s was unique. After World War II, with many Arab and Muslim states already in existence, and after six million Jews were slaughtered, the global community felt it was important to grant the Jewish people a homeland. In a more logical or just world that homeland would have been in Europe as a kind of reparation for what the Nazis and others before them had done to the Jews, or perhaps in the Americas ‚Äî like Alaska ‚Äî or somewhere else. But the Jews wanted Israel, the British had taken to the Zionist movement, the British had conquered the Ottoman Empire which handed them control of the land, and America and Europe didn‚Äôt want the Jews. As a result, we got Israel.  The Arab states had already rejected a partitioned Israel repeatedly before World War II and rejected it again after the Holocaust and the end of the war. They did not want to give up even a little bit of their land to a bunch of Jewish interlopers who were granted it all of a sudden by British interlopers who had arrived a hundred years prior. Who could blame them? It had been centuries since Jews lived there in large numbers, and now they wanted to return in waves as secularized Europeans. Many of us would probably react the same way. So, just as humans have done forever, they fought. The many existing Arab states turned against the burgeoning new Jewish state. One side won and one side lost. This is the brutal and broken and violent world we live in, but it is what created the global world order we have now.  Are Israelis and British people ""colonizers"" because of this 20th century history? Sure. But that view flattens thousands of years of history and conflict, and the context of World War I and World War II. I don‚Äôt view Israelis and Brits as colonizers any more than the Assyrians or the Babylonians or the Romans or the Mongols or the Egyptians or the Ottomans who all battled over the same strip of land from as early as 800 years before Jesus‚Äôs time until now. The Jews who founded Israel just happened to have won the last big battle for it.  You can‚Äôt speak about this issue in a vacuum. You can\'t pretend that it wasn\'t just 60 years ago when Israel was surrounded on all sides by Arab states who wanted to wipe them off the face of the planet. Despite the balance of power shifting this century, that threat is still a reality. And you can\'t talk about that without remembering the only reason the Jews were in Israel in the first place was that they\'d spent the previous centuries fleeing a bunch of Europeans who also wanted to wipe them off the face of the planet. And then Hitler showed up.  American partisans have a narrow view of this history, and an Americentric lens that is infuriating to witness. As Lee Fang perfectly put it, ""Hamas would absolutely execute the ACAB lefties cheering on horrific violence against Israelis if they lived in Gaza & U.S. right-wingers blindly cheering on Israeli subjugation of Palestinians would rebel twice as violently if Americans were subjected to similar occupation.""  And yet, many Americans only view modern Israel as the ""powerful"" one in this dynamic. Which is true ‚Äî they obviously are. It isn\'t a fair fight and it hasn\'t been for decades because Israel\'s government is rich and resourceful, has the backing of the United States and most of Europe, and has an incredibly powerful military. At the same time, Israeli leadership has made technological and military advancements that have further tipped those scales ‚Äî all while the Israeli government has helped create a resource-thin open air prison of two million Arabs in Gaza.  Conversely, Palestinians are devoid of any real unified leadership, and the Arab world is now divided on the issue of Palestine. Israel is unwilling to give the people in Gaza and the West Bank more than an inch of freedom to live. These are largely the refugees and descendents of the refugees of the 1948 and 1967 wars that Israel won. And you can\'t keep two million people in the condition that those in the Gaza strip live in and not expect events like this.  I\'m sorry to say that while the blood on the ground is fresh. The Israelis who were killed in this attack largely have nothing to do with those conditions other than being born at a time when Israel and Jews have the upper hand in this conflict. Some of the victims weren‚Äôt even Israeli ‚Äî they were just tourists. This is why we describe them as ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù and why Hamas has only reaffirmed that they are a brutal terror organization with this attack ‚Äî an organization that I hope is quickly toppled, for the sake of both the Palestinian people and the Israelis. But as someone with a deep love for Israel, with friends in danger and people I know still missing, it breaks my heart to say it but I\'m saying it again because it remains perhaps the most salient point of context in a tangled mess full of centuries of context:  You cannot keep two million people living in the conditions people in Gaza are living in and expect peace.  You can\'t. And you shouldn‚Äôt. Their environment is antithetical to the human condition. Violent rebellion is guaranteed. Guaranteed. As sure as the sun rising.  And the cycle of violence seems locked in to self-perpetuate, because both sides see a score to settle:  1) Israel has already responded with a vengeance, and they will continue to. Their desire for violence is not unlike Hamas‚Äôs ‚Äî it‚Äôs just as much about blood for blood as any legitimate security measure. Israel will ‚Äúhave every right to respond with force."" Toppling Hamas ‚Äî a group, by the way, Israel erred in supporting ‚Äî will now be the objective, and civilian death will be seen as necessary collateral damage. But Israel will also do a bunch of things they don\'t have a right to. They will flatten apartment buildings and kill civilians and children and many in the global community will probably cheer them on while they do it. They have already stopped the flow of water, electricity, and food to two million people, and killed dozens of civilians in their retaliatory bombings. We should never accept this, never lose sight that this horror is being inflicted on human beings. As the group B‚ÄôTselem said, ‚ÄúThere is no justification for such crimes, whether they are committed as part of a struggle for freedom from oppression or cited as part of a war against terror.‚Äù I mourn for the innocents of Palestine just as I do for the innocents in Israel. As of late, many, many more have died on their side than Israel\'s. And many more Palestinians are likely to die in this spate of violence, too.  Unfortunately, most people in the West only pay attention to this story when Hamas or a Palestinian in Gaza or the West Bank commits an act of violence. Palestinian citizens die regularly at the hands of the Israeli military and their plight goes largely unnoticed until they respond with violence of their own. Israel had already killed an estimated 250 Palestinians, including 47 children, this year alone. And that is just in the West Bank.  2) Every single time Israel kills someone in the name of self-defense they create a handful of new radicalized extremists who will feel justified in wanting to take an Israeli life in retribution sometime in the future. Half of Gaza‚Äôs two million people are under the age of 19 ‚Äî they know little besides Hamas rule (since 2006), Israeli occupation, blockades, and rockets falling from the sky. The suffering of these innocent children born into this reality is incomprehensible to me. They will suffer more now because of Hamas‚Äôs actions and Israel‚Äôs response, all through no fault of their own.  There is no way out of this pattern until one side exercises restraint or leaders on both sides find a new solution. Israelis will tell you that if Palestinians put their guns down then the war would end, but if Israel put their guns down they\'d be wiped off the planet. I don\'t have a crystal ball and can‚Äôt tell you what is true. But what I am certain of is that every time Israel kills more innocents they engender more rage and hatred and recruit more Palestinians and Arabs to the cause against them. There is no disputing this.  So, why did this happen now?  I\'m not sure how to answer that question except to say it was bound to happen eventually. It was a massive policy and intelligence failure and Netanyahu should pay the price politically ‚Äî he is a failed leader. Iran probably helped organize the attack and the money freed up by the Biden administration\'s prisoner swap probably didn\'t help the situation, either. Israel\'s increasingly extremist government and settlers provoking Palestinians certainly didn\'t help. Nor has going to the Al-Aqsa mosque and desecrating it. Nor do blockades and bombings and indiscriminate subjugation of a whole people. Nor does refusing to talk to non-terrorist leaders in Palestine. Nor does illegally continuing to expand and steal what is left of Palestinian land, as many Jews and Israelis have been doing in the 21st century despite cries from the global community to stop. A violent response was predictable ‚Äî in fact, plenty of people did predict it.  Israel is forever stuffing these people into tinier and tinier boxes with fewer and fewer resources. But if you want to blame Israeli leaders for continuing to expand and settle land that does not belong to them (as I do), then you should also spare some blame for Palestinian leaders for repeatedly not accepting a partitioned Israel during the 20th century that could have led to peace (as I do).  Please also remember this: Hamas is still an extremist group. The Palestinian people do not have a government or leaders who legitimately represent their interests, and it sure as hell isn\'t Hamas. Will some Palestinians cheer and clap at the dead, or spit on them as they are paraded through Gaza? Yes they will. And they have. Many will also mourn because they loathe Hamas and know this will only make things worse. This is no different than how some Americans cheer at the dead in every single war we\'ve ever fought. It\'s no different than the Israelis who set up lawn chairs to watch their government bomb Palestine and cheer them on, too. This doesn\'t mean Palestinians or Israelis or Americans are evil ‚Äî it means some of them are giving in to their violent impulses, and their zealous feelings of righteous vengeance.  Solutions, you ask? I can‚Äôt say I have any. If you came here for that, I‚Äôm sorry. The two-state solution looks dead to me. A three-state solution makes some sense but feels out of the view of all the people who matter and could make it happen. I wish a one-state solution felt realistic ‚Äî a world of Israelis and Arabs and Muslims and Jews living side by side with equal rights, fully integrated and defused of their hate, is a version of Israel that I would adore. But it seems less and less realistic with every new act of violence.  Am I pro-Israel or pro-Palestine? I have no idea.  I\'m pro-not-killing-civilians.  I\'m pro-not-trapping-millions-of-people-in-open-air-prisons.  I\'m pro-not-shooting-grandmas-in-the-back-of-the-head.  I\'m pro-not-flattening-apartment-complexes.  I\'m pro-not-raping-women-and-taking-hostages.  I\'m pro-not-unjustly-imprisoning-people-without-due-process.  I\'m pro-freedom and pro-peace and pro- all the things we never see in this conflict anymore.

Please read!,"Oct 11, 2023 ¬∑ 7:56 PM UTC",False,,"{'link': 'https://twitter.com/Ike_Saul/status/1711780282725011520#m', 'text': 'People ask me all the time if I am ""pro-Israel"" because I am a Jew who has lived in Israel, and my answer is that being ""pro-Israel"" or being ""pro-Palestine"" or being a ""Zionist"" does not properly capture the nuance of thought most people do or should have about this issue. It certainly doesn\'t capture mine.  I have a lot to say. I‚Äôve spent the last 72 hours writing, texting, and talking to Israelis, Jews, Muslims, and Palestinians. Much of my reaction is going to piss off people on ""both sides,"" but I am exhausted and hurting and I do not think there is any way to discuss this situation without being radically honest about my views. So I\'m going to try to say what I believe to be true the best I can.  Let me start with this: It could have been me.  That\'s a hard thought to shake when watching the videos out of Israel ‚Äî the concert goers fleeing across an empty expanse, the hostages being paraded through the streets, the people shot in the head at bus stops or in their cars. I went to those parties in the desert, I rubbed shoulders with Israelis and Arabs and Jews and Muslims, I could have easily accepted an invitation to some concert near Sderot and gone without a care, only to be indiscriminately slaughtered. Or, perhaps worse, taken hostage and tortured.  I don‚Äôt believe Hamas is killing Israelis to liberate themselves, nor do I believe they are doing it to make peace. They\'re doing this because they represent the devil on the shoulder of every oppressed Palestinian who has lost someone in this conflict. They\'re doing it because they want vengeance. They are evening the score, and acting on the worst of our human impulses, to respond to blood with blood ‚Äî an inclination that is easy to give in to after what their people have endured. It should not be hard to understand their logic ‚Äî it is only hard to accept that humans are capable of being driven to this. Not defending Hamas is a very low bar to clear. Please clear it.  It‚Äôs not possible to recap the entire 5,000 year history of people fighting over this strip of land in one newsletter. There are plenty of easily accessible places you can learn about it if you want to (and, by the way, many of you should ‚Äî far too many people speak on this issue with an obscene amount of ignorance, loads of arrogance, and a narrow historical lens focused on the last few decades). But I\'ll briefly highlight a few things that are important to me.  In my opinion, the Jewish people have a legitimate historical claim to the land of Israel. Jews had already been expelled and returned and expelled again a half dozen times before the rise of the Muslim and Arab rule of the Ottoman Empire. Of course it‚Äôs messy because we Jews and Arabs and Muslims are all cousins and descendents of the same Canaanites. But Arabs won the land centuries ago the same way Israel and Jews won it in the 20th century: Through conflict and war. The British defeated the Ottoman Empire and then came the Balfour Declaration, which amounted to the British granting the area to the Jewish people, a promise they‚Äôd later try to renege on ‚Äî all before the wars that have defined the region since 1948.  That historical moment in the late 1940s was unique. After World War II, with many Arab and Muslim states already in existence, and after six million Jews were slaughtered, the global community felt it was important to grant the Jewish people a homeland. In a more logical or just world that homeland would have been in Europe as a kind of reparation for what the Nazis and others before them had done to the Jews, or perhaps in the Americas ‚Äî like Alaska ‚Äî or somewhere else. But the Jews wanted Israel, the British had taken to the Zionist movement, the British had conquered the Ottoman Empire which handed them control of the land, and America and Europe didn‚Äôt want the Jews. As a result, we got Israel.  The Arab states had already rejected a partitioned Israel repeatedly before World War II and rejected it again after the Holocaust and the end of the war. They did not want to give up even a little bit of their land to a bunch of Jewish interlopers who were granted it all of a sudden by British interlopers who had arrived a hundred years prior. Who could blame them? It had been centuries since Jews lived there in large numbers, and now they wanted to return in waves as secularized Europeans. Many of us would probably react the same way. So, just as humans have done forever, they fought. The many existing Arab states turned against the burgeoning new Jewish state. One side won and one side lost. This is the brutal and broken and violent world we live in, but it is what created the global world order we have now.  Are Israelis and British people ""colonizers"" because of this 20th century history? Sure. But that view flattens thousands of years of history and conflict, and the context of World War I and World War II. I don‚Äôt view Israelis and Brits as colonizers any more than the Assyrians or the Babylonians or the Romans or the Mongols or the Egyptians or the Ottomans who all battled over the same strip of land from as early as 800 years before Jesus‚Äôs time until now. The Jews who founded Israel just happened to have won the last big battle for it.  You can‚Äôt speak about this issue in a vacuum. You can\'t pretend that it wasn\'t just 60 years ago when Israel was surrounded on all sides by Arab states who wanted to wipe them off the face of the planet. Despite the balance of power shifting this century, that threat is still a reality. And you can\'t talk about that without remembering the only reason the Jews were in Israel in the first place was that they\'d spent the previous centuries fleeing a bunch of Europeans who also wanted to wipe them off the face of the planet. And then Hitler showed up.  American partisans have a narrow view of this history, and an Americentric lens that is infuriating to witness. As Lee Fang perfectly put it, ""Hamas would absolutely execute the ACAB lefties cheering on horrific violence against Israelis if they lived in Gaza & U.S. right-wingers blindly cheering on Israeli subjugation of Palestinians would rebel twice as violently if Americans were subjected to similar occupation.""  And yet, many Americans only view modern Israel as the ""powerful"" one in this dynamic. Which is true ‚Äî they obviously are. It isn\'t a fair fight and it hasn\'t been for decades because Israel\'s government is rich and resourceful, has the backing of the United States and most of Europe, and has an incredibly powerful military. At the same time, Israeli leadership has made technological and military advancements that have further tipped those scales ‚Äî all while the Israeli government has helped create a resource-thin open air prison of two million Arabs in Gaza.  Conversely, Palestinians are devoid of any real unified leadership, and the Arab world is now divided on the issue of Palestine. Israel is unwilling to give the people in Gaza and the West Bank more than an inch of freedom to live. These are largely the refugees and descendents of the refugees of the 1948 and 1967 wars that Israel won. And you can\'t keep two million people in the condition that those in the Gaza strip live in and not expect events like this.  I\'m sorry to say that while the blood on the ground is fresh. The Israelis who were killed in this attack largely have nothing to do with those conditions other than being born at a time when Israel and Jews have the upper hand in this conflict. Some of the victims weren‚Äôt even Israeli ‚Äî they were just tourists. This is why we describe them as ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù and why Hamas has only reaffirmed that they are a brutal terror organization with this attack ‚Äî an organization that I hope is quickly toppled, for the sake of both the Palestinian people and the Israelis. But as someone with a deep love for Israel, with friends in danger and people I know still missing, it breaks my heart to say it but I\'m saying it again because it remains perhaps the most salient point of context in a tangled mess full of centuries of context:  You cannot keep two million people living in the conditions people in Gaza are living in and expect peace.  You can\'t. And you shouldn‚Äôt. Their environment is antithetical to the human condition. Violent rebellion is guaranteed. Guaranteed. As sure as the sun rising.  And the cycle of violence seems locked in to self-perpetuate, because both sides see a score to settle:  1) Israel has already responded with a vengeance, and they will continue to. Their desire for violence is not unlike Hamas‚Äôs ‚Äî it‚Äôs just as much about blood for blood as any legitimate security measure. Israel will ‚Äúhave every right to respond with force."" Toppling Hamas ‚Äî a group, by the way, Israel erred in supporting ‚Äî will now be the objective, and civilian death will be seen as necessary collateral damage. But Israel will also do a bunch of things they don\'t have a right to. They will flatten apartment buildings and kill civilians and children and many in the global community will probably cheer them on while they do it. They have already stopped the flow of water, electricity, and food to two million people, and killed dozens of civilians in their retaliatory bombings. We should never accept this, never lose sight that this horror is being inflicted on human beings. As the group B‚ÄôTselem said, ‚ÄúThere is no justification for such crimes, whether they are committed as part of a struggle for freedom from oppression or cited as part of a war against terror.‚Äù I mourn for the innocents of Palestine just as I do for the innocents in Israel. As of late, many, many more have died on their side than Israel\'s. And many more Palestinians are likely to die in this spate of violence, too.  Unfortunately, most people in the West only pay attention to this story when Hamas or a Palestinian in Gaza or the West Bank commits an act of violence. Palestinian citizens die regularly at the hands of the Israeli military and their plight goes largely unnoticed until they respond with violence of their own. Israel had already killed an estimated 250 Palestinians, including 47 children, this year alone. And that is just in the West Bank.  2) Every single time Israel kills someone in the name of self-defense they create a handful of new radicalized extremists who will feel justified in wanting to take an Israeli life in retribution sometime in the future. Half of Gaza‚Äôs two million people are under the age of 19 ‚Äî they know little besides Hamas rule (since 2006), Israeli occupation, blockades, and rockets falling from the sky. The suffering of these innocent children born into this reality is incomprehensible to me. They will suffer more now because of Hamas‚Äôs actions and Israel‚Äôs response, all through no fault of their own.  There is no way out of this pattern until one side exercises restraint or leaders on both sides find a new solution. Israelis will tell you that if Palestinians put their guns down then the war would end, but if Israel put their guns down they\'d be wiped off the planet. I don\'t have a crystal ball and can‚Äôt tell you what is true. But what I am certain of is that every time Israel kills more innocents they engender more rage and hatred and recruit more Palestinians and Arabs to the cause against them. There is no disputing this.  So, why did this happen now?  I\'m not sure how to answer that question except to say it was bound to happen eventually. It was a massive policy and intelligence failure and Netanyahu should pay the price politically ‚Äî he is a failed leader. Iran probably helped organize the attack and the money freed up by the Biden administration\'s prisoner swap probably didn\'t help the situation, either. Israel\'s increasingly extremist government and settlers provoking Palestinians certainly didn\'t help. Nor has going to the Al-Aqsa mosque and desecrating it. Nor do blockades and bombings and indiscriminate subjugation of a whole people. Nor does refusing to talk to non-terrorist leaders in Palestine. Nor does illegally continuing to expand and steal what is left of Palestinian land, as many Jews and Israelis have been doing in the 21st century despite cries from the global community to stop. A violent response was predictable ‚Äî in fact, plenty of people did predict it.  Israel is forever stuffing these people into tinier and tinier boxes with fewer and fewer resources. But if you want to blame Israeli leaders for continuing to expand and settle land that does not belong to them (as I do), then you should also spare some blame for Palestinian leaders for repeatedly not accepting a partitioned Israel during the 20th century that could have led to peace (as I do).  Please also remember this: Hamas is still an extremist group. The Palestinian people do not have a government or leaders who legitimately represent their interests, and it sure as hell isn\'t Hamas. Will some Palestinians cheer and clap at the dead, or spit on them as they are paraded through Gaza? Yes they will. And they have. Many will also mourn because they loathe Hamas and know this will only make things worse. This is no different than how some Americans cheer at the dead in every single war we\'ve ever fought. It\'s no different than the Israelis who set up lawn chairs to watch their government bomb Palestine and cheer them on, too. This doesn\'t mean Palestinians or Israelis or Americans are evil ‚Äî it means some of them are giving in to their violent impulses, and their zealous feelings of righteous vengeance.  Solutions, you ask? I can‚Äôt say I have any. If you came here for that, I‚Äôm sorry. The two-state solution looks dead to me. A three-state solution makes some sense but feels out of the view of all the people who matter and could make it happen. I wish a one-state solution felt realistic ‚Äî a world of Israelis and Arabs and Muslims and Jews living side by side with equal rights, fully integrated and defused of their hate, is a version of Israel that I would adore. But it seems less and less realistic with every new act of violence.  Am I pro-Israel or pro-Palestine? I have no idea.  I\'m pro-not-killing-civilians.  I\'m pro-not-trapping-millions-of-people-in-open-air-prisons.  I\'m pro-not-shooting-grandmas-in-the-back-of-the-head.  I\'m pro-not-flattening-apartment-complexes.  I\'m pro-not-raping-women-and-taking-hostages.  I\'m pro-not-unjustly-imprisoning-people-without-due-process.  I\'m pro-freedom and pro-peace and pro- all the things we never see in this conflict anymore.

I went to those parties in the desert, I rubbed shoulders with Israelis and Arabs and Jews and Muslims, I could have easily accepted an invitation to some concert near Sderot and gone without a care, only to be indiscriminately slaughtered. Or, perhaps worse, taken hostage and tortured.  I don‚Äôt believe Hamas is killing Israelis to liberate themselves, nor do I believe they are doing it to make peace. They\'re doing this because they represent the devil on the shoulder of every oppressed Palestinian who has lost someone in this conflict. They\'re doing it because they want vengeance. They are evening the score, and acting on the worst of our human impulses, to respond to blood with blood ‚Äî an inclination that is easy to give in to after what their people have endured. It should not be hard to understand their logic ‚Äî it is only hard to accept that humans are capable of being driven to this. Not defending Hamas is a very low bar to clear. Please clear it.  It‚Äôs not possible to recap the entire 5,000 year history of people fighting over this strip of land in one newsletter. There are plenty of easily accessible places you can learn about it if you want to (and, by the way, many of you should ‚Äî far too many people speak on this issue with an obscene amount of ignorance, loads of arrogance, and a narrow historical lens focused on the last few decades). But I\'ll briefly highlight a few things that are important to me.  In my opinion, the Jewish people have a legitimate historical claim to the land of Israel. Jews had already been expelled and returned and expelled again a half dozen times before the rise of the Muslim and Arab rule of the Ottoman Empire. Of course it‚Äôs messy because we Jews and Arabs and Muslims are all cousins and descendents of the same Canaanites. But Arabs won the land centuries ago the same way Israel and Jews won it in the 20th century: Through conflict and war. The British defeated the Ottoman Empire and then came the Balfour Declaration, which amounted to the British granting the area to the Jewish people, a promise they‚Äôd later try to renege on ‚Äî all before the wars that have defined the region since 1948.  That historical moment in the late 1940s was unique. After World War II, with many Arab and Muslim states already in existence, and after six million Jews were slaughtered, the global community felt it was important to grant the Jewish people a homeland. In a more logical or just world that homeland would have been in Europe as a kind of reparation for what the Nazis and others before them had done to the Jews, or perhaps in the Americas ‚Äî like Alaska ‚Äî or somewhere else. But the Jews wanted Israel, the British had taken to the Zionist movement, the British had conquered the Ottoman Empire which handed them control of the land, and America and Europe didn‚Äôt want the Jews. As a result, we got Israel.  The Arab states had already rejected a partitioned Israel repeatedly before World War II and rejected it again after the Holocaust and the end of the war. They did not want to give up even a little bit of their land to a bunch of Jewish interlopers who were granted it all of a sudden by British interlopers who had arrived a hundred years prior. Who could blame them? It had been centuries since Jews lived there in large numbers, and now they wanted to return in waves as secularized Europeans. Many of us would probably react the same way. So, just as humans have done forever, they fought. The many existing Arab states turned against the burgeoning new Jewish state. One side won and one side lost. This is the brutal and broken and violent world we live in, but it is what created the global world order we have now.  Are Israelis and British people ""colonizers"" because of this 20th century history? Sure. But that view flattens thousands of years of history and conflict, and the context of World War I and World War II. I don‚Äôt view Israelis and Brits as colonizers any more than the Assyrians or the Babylonians or the Romans or the Mongols or the Egyptians or the Ottomans who all battled over the same strip of land from as early as 800 years before Jesus‚Äôs time until now. The Jews who founded Israel just happened to have won the last big battle for it.  You can‚Äôt speak about this issue in a vacuum. You can\'t pretend that it wasn\'t just 60 years ago when Israel was surrounded on all sides by Arab states who wanted to wipe them off the face of the planet. Despite the balance of power shifting this century, that threat is still a reality. And you can\'t talk about that without remembering the only reason the Jews were in Israel in the first place was that they\'d spent the previous centuries fleeing a bunch of Europeans who also wanted to wipe them off the face of the planet. And then Hitler showed up.  American partisans have a narrow view of this history, and an Americentric lens that is infuriating to witness. As Lee Fang perfectly put it, ""Hamas would absolutely execute the ACAB lefties cheering on horrific violence against Israelis if they lived in Gaza & U.S. right-wingers blindly cheering on Israeli subjugation of Palestinians would rebel twice as violently if Americans were subjected to similar occupation.""  And yet, many Americans only view modern Israel as the ""powerful"" one in this dynamic. Which is true ‚Äî they obviously are. It isn\'t a fair fight and it hasn\'t been for decades because Israel\'s government is rich and resourceful, has the backing of the United States and most of Europe, and has an incredibly powerful military. At the same time, Israeli leadership has made technological and military advancements that have further tipped those scales ‚Äî all while the Israeli government has helped create a resource-thin open air prison of two million Arabs in Gaza.  Conversely, Palestinians are devoid of any real unified leadership, and the Arab world is now divided on the issue of Palestine. Israel is unwilling to give the people in Gaza and the West Bank more than an inch of freedom to live. These are largely the refugees and descendents of the refugees of the 1948 and 1967 wars that Israel won. And you can\'t keep two million people in the condition that those in the Gaza strip live in and not expect events like this.  I\'m sorry to say that while the blood on the ground is fresh. The Israelis who were killed in this attack largely have nothing to do with those conditions other than being born at a time when Israel and Jews have the upper hand in this conflict. Some of the victims weren‚Äôt even Israeli ‚Äî they were just tourists. This is why we describe them as ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù and why Hamas has only reaffirmed that they are a brutal terror organization with this attack ‚Äî an organization that I hope is quickly toppled, for the sake of both the Palestinian people and the Israelis. But as someone with a deep love for Israel, with friends in danger and people I know still missing, it breaks my heart to say it but I\'m saying it again because it remains perhaps the most salient point of context in a tangled mess full of centuries of context:  You cannot keep two million people living in the conditions people in Gaza are living in and expect peace.  You can\'t. And you shouldn‚Äôt. Their environment is antithetical to the human condition. Violent rebellion is guaranteed. Guaranteed. As sure as the sun rising.  And the cycle of violence seems locked in to self-perpetuate, because both sides see a score to settle:  1) Israel has already responded with a vengeance, and they will continue to. Their desire for violence is not unlike Hamas‚Äôs ‚Äî it‚Äôs just as much about blood for blood as any legitimate security measure. Israel will ‚Äúhave every right to respond with force."" Toppling Hamas ‚Äî a group, by the way, Israel erred in supporting ‚Äî will now be the objective, and civilian death will be seen as necessary collateral damage. But Israel will also do a bunch of things they don\'t have a right to. They will flatten apartment buildings and kill civilians and children and many in the global community will probably cheer them on while they do it. They have already stopped the flow of water, electricity, and food to two million people, and killed dozens of civilians in their retaliatory bombings. We should never accept this, never lose sight that this horror is being inflicted on human beings. As the group B‚ÄôTselem said, ‚ÄúThere is no justification for such crimes, whether they are committed as part of a struggle for freedom from oppression or cited as part of a war against terror.‚Äù I mourn for the innocents of Palestine just as I do for the innocents in Israel. As of late, many, many more have died on their side than Israel\'s. And many more Palestinians are likely to die in this spate of violence, too.  Unfortunately, most people in the West only pay attention to this story when Hamas or a Palestinian in Gaza or the West Bank commits an act of violence. Palestinian citizens die regularly at the hands of the Israeli military and their plight goes largely unnoticed until they respond with violence of their own. Israel had already killed an estimated 250 Palestinians, including 47 children, this year alone. And that is just in the West Bank.  2) Every single time Israel kills someone in the name of self-defense they create a handful of new radicalized extremists who will feel justified in wanting to take an Israeli life in retribution sometime in the future. Half of Gaza‚Äôs two million people are under the age of 19 ‚Äî they know little besides Hamas rule (since 2006), Israeli occupation, blockades, and rockets falling from the sky. The suffering of these innocent children born into this reality is incomprehensible to me. They will suffer more now because of Hamas‚Äôs actions and Israel‚Äôs response, all through no fault of their own.  There is no way out of this pattern until one side exercises restraint or leaders on both sides find a new solution. Israelis will tell you that if Palestinians put their guns down then the war would end, but if Israel put their guns down they\'d be wiped off the planet. I don\'t have a crystal ball and can‚Äôt tell you what is true. But what I am certain of is that every time Israel kills more innocents they engender more rage and hatred and recruit more Palestinians and Arabs to the cause against them. There is no disputing this.  So, why did this happen now?  I\'m not sure how to answer that question except to say it was bound to happen eventually. It was a massive policy and intelligence failure and Netanyahu should pay the price politically ‚Äî he is a failed leader. Iran probably helped organize the attack and the money freed up by the Biden administration\'s prisoner swap probably didn\'t help the situation, either. Israel\'s increasingly extremist government and settlers provoking Palestinians certainly didn\'t help. Nor has going to the Al-Aqsa mosque and desecrating it. Nor do blockades and bombings and indiscriminate subjugation of a whole people. Nor does refusing to talk to non-terrorist leaders in Palestine. Nor does illegally continuing to expand and steal what is left of Palestinian land, as many Jews and Israelis have been doing in the 21st century despite cries from the global community to stop. A violent response was predictable ‚Äî in fact, plenty of people did predict it.  Israel is forever stuffing these people into tinier and tinier boxes with fewer and fewer resources. But if you want to blame Israeli leaders for continuing to expand and settle land that does not belong to them (as I do), then you should also spare some blame for Palestinian leaders for repeatedly not accepting a partitioned Israel during the 20th century that could have led to peace (as I do).  Please also remember this: Hamas is still an extremist group. The Palestinian people do not have a government or leaders who legitimately represent their interests, and it sure as hell isn\'t Hamas. Will some Palestinians cheer and clap at the dead, or spit on them as they are paraded through Gaza? Yes they will. And they have. Many will also mourn because they loathe Hamas and know this will only make things worse. This is no different than how some Americans cheer at the dead in every single war we\'ve ever fought. It\'s no different than the Israelis who set up lawn chairs to watch their government bomb Palestine and cheer them on, too. This doesn\'t mean Palestinians or Israelis or Americans are evil ‚Äî it means some of them are giving in to their violent impulses, and their zealous feelings of righteous vengeance.  Solutions, you ask? I can‚Äôt say I have any. If you came here for that, I‚Äôm sorry. The two-state solution looks dead to me. A three-state solution makes some sense but feels out of the view of all the people who matter and could make it happen. I wish a one-state solution felt realistic ‚Äî a world of Israelis and Arabs and Muslims and Jews living side by side with equal rights, fully integrated and defused of their hate, is a version of Israel that I would adore. But it seems less and less realistic with every new act of violence.  Am I pro-Israel or pro-Palestine? I have no idea.  I\'m pro-not-killing-civilians.  I\'m pro-not-trapping-millions-of-people-in-open-air-prisons.  I\'m pro-not-shooting-grandmas-in-the-back-of-the-head.  I\'m pro-not-flattening-apartment-complexes.  I\'m pro-not-raping-women-and-taking-hostages.  I\'m pro-not-unjustly-imprisoning-people-without-due-process.  I\'m pro-freedom and pro-peace and pro- all the things we never see in this conflict anymore.

It certainly doesn\'t capture mine.  I have a lot to say. I‚Äôve spent the last 72 hours writing, texting, and talking to Israelis, Jews, Muslims, and Palestinians. Much of my reaction is going to piss off people on ""both sides,"" but I am exhausted and hurting and I do not think there is any way to discuss this situation without being radically honest about my views. So I\'m going to try to say what I believe to be true the best I can.  Let me start with this: It could have been me.  That\'s a hard thought to shake when watching the videos out of Israel ‚Äî the concert goers fleeing across an empty expanse, the hostages being paraded through the streets, the people shot in the head at bus stops or in their cars. I went to those parties in the desert, I rubbed shoulders with Israelis and Arabs and Jews and Muslims, I could have easily accepted an invitation to some concert near Sderot and gone without a care, only to be indiscriminately slaughtered. Or, perhaps worse, taken hostage and tortured.  I don‚Äôt believe Hamas is killing Israelis to liberate themselves, nor do I believe they are doing it to make peace. They\'re doing this because they represent the devil on the shoulder of every oppressed Palestinian who has lost someone in this conflict. They\'re doing it because they want vengeance. They are evening the score, and acting on the worst of our human impulses, to respond to blood with blood ‚Äî an inclination that is easy to give in to after what their people have endured. It should not be hard to understand their logic ‚Äî it is only hard to accept that humans are capable of being driven to this. Not defending Hamas is a very low bar to clear. Please clear it.  It‚Äôs not possible to recap the entire 5,000 year history of people fighting over this strip of land in one newsletter. There are plenty of easily accessible places you can learn about it if you want to (and, by the way, many of you should ‚Äî far too many people speak on this issue with an obscene amount of ignorance, loads of arrogance, and a narrow historical lens focused on the last few decades). But I\'ll briefly highlight a few things that are important to me.  In my opinion, the Jewish people have a legitimate historical claim to the land of Israel. Jews had already been expelled and returned and expelled again a half dozen times before the rise of the Muslim and Arab rule of the Ottoman Empire. Of course it‚Äôs messy because we Jews and Arabs and Muslims are all cousins and descendents of the same Canaanites. But Arabs won the land centuries ago the same way Israel and Jews won it in the 20th century: Through conflict and war. The British defeated the Ottoman Empire and then came the Balfour Declaration, which amounted to the British granting the area to the Jewish people, a promise they‚Äôd later try to renege on ‚Äî all before the wars that have defined the region since 1948.  That historical moment in the late 1940s was unique. After World War II, with many Arab and Muslim states already in existence, and after six million Jews were slaughtered, the global community felt it was important to grant the Jewish people a homeland. In a more logical or just world that homeland would have been in Europe as a kind of reparation for what the Nazis and others before them had done to the Jews, or perhaps in the Americas ‚Äî like Alaska ‚Äî or somewhere else. But the Jews wanted Israel, the British had taken to the Zionist movement, the British had conquered the Ottoman Empire which handed them control of the land, and America and Europe didn‚Äôt want the Jews. As a result, we got Israel.  The Arab states had already rejected a partitioned Israel repeatedly before World War II and rejected it again after the Holocaust and the end of the war. They did not want to give up even a little bit of their land to a bunch of Jewish interlopers who were granted it all of a sudden by British interlopers who had arrived a hundred years prior. Who could blame them? It had been centuries since Jews lived there in large numbers, and now they wanted to return in waves as secularized Europeans. Many of us would probably react the same way. So, just as humans have done forever, they fought. The many existing Arab states turned against the burgeoning new Jewish state. One side won and one side lost. This is the brutal and broken and violent world we live in, but it is what created the global world order we have now.  Are Israelis and British people ""colonizers"" because of this 20th century history? Sure. But that view flattens thousands of years of history and conflict, and the context of World War I and World War II. I don‚Äôt view Israelis and Brits as colonizers any more than the Assyrians or the Babylonians or the Romans or the Mongols or the Egyptians or the Ottomans who all battled over the same strip of land from as early as 800 years before Jesus‚Äôs time until now. The Jews who founded Israel just happened to have won the last big battle for it.  You can‚Äôt speak about this issue in a vacuum. You can\'t pretend that it wasn\'t just 60 years ago when Israel was surrounded on all sides by Arab states who wanted to wipe them off the face of the planet. Despite the balance of power shifting this century, that threat is still a reality. And you can\'t talk about that without remembering the only reason the Jews were in Israel in the first place was that they\'d spent the previous centuries fleeing a bunch of Europeans who also wanted to wipe them off the face of the planet. And then Hitler showed up.  American partisans have a narrow view of this history, and an Americentric lens that is infuriating to witness. As Lee Fang perfectly put it, ""Hamas would absolutely execute the ACAB lefties cheering on horrific violence against Israelis if they lived in Gaza & U.S. right-wingers blindly cheering on Israeli subjugation of Palestinians would rebel twice as violently if Americans were subjected to similar occupation.""  And yet, many Americans only view modern Israel as the ""powerful"" one in this dynamic. Which is true ‚Äî they obviously are. It isn\'t a fair fight and it hasn\'t been for decades because Israel\'s government is rich and resourceful, has the backing of the United States and most of Europe, and has an incredibly powerful military. At the same time, Israeli leadership has made technological and military advancements that have further tipped those scales ‚Äî all while the Israeli government has helped create a resource-thin open air prison of two million Arabs in Gaza.  Conversely, Palestinians are devoid of any real unified leadership, and the Arab world is now divided on the issue of Palestine. Israel is unwilling to give the people in Gaza and the West Bank more than an inch of freedom to live. These are largely the refugees and descendents of the refugees of the 1948 and 1967 wars that Israel won. And you can\'t keep two million people in the condition that those in the Gaza strip live in and not expect events like this.  I\'m sorry to say that while the blood on the ground is fresh. The Israelis who were killed in this attack largely have nothing to do with those conditions other than being born at a time when Israel and Jews have the upper hand in this conflict. Some of the victims weren‚Äôt even Israeli ‚Äî they were just tourists. This is why we describe them as ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù and why Hamas has only reaffirmed that they are a brutal terror organization with this attack ‚Äî an organization that I hope is quickly toppled, for the sake of both the Palestinian people and the Israelis. But as someone with a deep love for Israel, with friends in danger and people I know still missing, it breaks my heart to say it but I\'m saying it again because it remains perhaps the most salient point of context in a tangled mess full of centuries of context:  You cannot keep two million people living in the conditions people in Gaza are living in and expect peace.  You can\'t. And you shouldn‚Äôt. Their environment is antithetical to the human condition. Violent rebellion is guaranteed. Guaranteed. As sure as the sun rising.  And the cycle of violence seems locked in to self-perpetuate, because both sides see a score to settle:  1) Israel has already responded with a vengeance, and they will continue to. Their desire for violence is not unlike Hamas‚Äôs ‚Äî it‚Äôs just as much about blood for blood as any legitimate security measure. Israel will ‚Äúhave every right to respond with force."" Toppling Hamas ‚Äî a group, by the way, Israel erred in supporting ‚Äî will now be the objective, and civilian death will be seen as necessary collateral damage. But Israel will also do a bunch of things they don\'t have a right to. They will flatten apartment buildings and kill civilians and children and many in the global community will probably cheer them on while they do it. They have already stopped the flow of water, electricity, and food to two million people, and killed dozens of civilians in their retaliatory bombings. We should never accept this, never lose sight that this horror is being inflicted on human beings. As the group B‚ÄôTselem said, ‚ÄúThere is no justification for such crimes, whether they are committed as part of a struggle for freedom from oppression or cited as part of a war against terror.‚Äù I mourn for the innocents of Palestine just as I do for the innocents in Israel. As of late, many, many more have died on their side than Israel\'s. And many more Palestinians are likely to die in this spate of violence, too.  Unfortunately, most people in the West only pay attention to this story when Hamas or a Palestinian in Gaza or the West Bank commits an act of violence. Palestinian citizens die regularly at the hands of the Israeli military and their plight goes largely unnoticed until they respond with violence of their own. Israel had already killed an estimated 250 Palestinians, including 47 children, this year alone. And that is just in the West Bank.  2) Every single time Israel kills someone in the name of self-defense they create a handful of new radicalized extremists who will feel justified in wanting to take an Israeli life in retribution sometime in the future. Half of Gaza‚Äôs two million people are under the age of 19 ‚Äî they know little besides Hamas rule (since 2006), Israeli occupation, blockades, and rockets falling from the sky. The suffering of these innocent children born into this reality is incomprehensible to me. They will suffer more now because of Hamas‚Äôs actions and Israel‚Äôs response, all through no fault of their own.  There is no way out of this pattern until one side exercises restraint or leaders on both sides find a new solution. Israelis will tell you that if Palestinians put their guns down then the war would end, but if Israel put their guns down they\'d be wiped off the planet. I don\'t have a crystal ball and can‚Äôt tell you what is true. But what I am certain of is that every time Israel kills more innocents they engender more rage and hatred and recruit more Palestinians and Arabs to the cause against them. There is no disputing this.  So, why did this happen now?  I\'m not sure how to answer that question except to say it was bound to happen eventually. It was a massive policy and intelligence failure and Netanyahu should pay the price politically ‚Äî he is a failed leader. Iran probably helped organize the attack and the money freed up by the Biden administration\'s prisoner swap probably didn\'t help the situation, either. Israel\'s increasingly extremist government and settlers provoking Palestinians certainly didn\'t help. Nor has going to the Al-Aqsa mosque and desecrating it. Nor do blockades and bombings and indiscriminate subjugation of a whole people. Nor does refusing to talk to non-terrorist leaders in Palestine. Nor does illegally continuing to expand and steal what is left of Palestinian land, as many Jews and Israelis have been doing in the 21st century despite cries from the global community to stop. A violent response was predictable ‚Äî in fact, plenty of people did predict it.  Israel is forever stuffing these people into tinier and tinier boxes with fewer and fewer resources. But if you want to blame Israeli leaders for continuing to expand and settle land that does not belong to them (as I do), then you should also spare some blame for Palestinian leaders for repeatedly not accepting a partitioned Israel during the 20th century that could have led to peace (as I do).  Please also remember this: Hamas is still an extremist group. The Palestinian people do not have a government or leaders who legitimately represent their interests, and it sure as hell isn\'t Hamas. Will some Palestinians cheer and clap at the dead, or spit on them as they are paraded through Gaza? Yes they will. And they have. Many will also mourn because they loathe Hamas and know this will only make things worse. This is no different than how some Americans cheer at the dead in every single war we\'ve ever fought. It\'s no different than the Israelis who set up lawn chairs to watch their government bomb Palestine and cheer them on, too. This doesn\'t mean Palestinians or Israelis or Americans are evil ‚Äî it means some of them are giving in to their violent impulses, and their zealous feelings of righteous vengeance.  Solutions, you ask? I can‚Äôt say I have any. If you came here for that, I‚Äôm sorry. The two-state solution looks dead to me. A three-state solution makes some sense but feels out of the view of all the people who matter and could make it happen. I wish a one-state solution felt realistic ‚Äî a world of Israelis and Arabs and Muslims and Jews living side by side with equal rights, fully integrated and defused of their hate, is a version of Israel that I would adore. But it seems less and less realistic with every new act of violence.  Am I pro-Israel or pro-Palestine? I have no idea.  I\'m pro-not-killing-civilians.  I\'m pro-not-trapping-millions-of-people-in-open-air-prisons.  I\'m pro-not-shooting-grandmas-in-the-back-of-the-head.  I\'m pro-not-flattening-apartment-complexes.  I\'m pro-not-raping-women-and-taking-hostages.  I\'m pro-not-unjustly-imprisoning-people-without-due-process.

It certainly doesn\'t capture mine.  I have a lot to say. I‚Äôve spent the last 72 hours writing, texting, and talking to Israelis, Jews, Muslims, and Palestinians. Much of my reaction is going to piss off people on ""both sides,"" but I am exhausted and hurting and I do not think there is any way to discuss this situation without being radically honest about my views. So I\'m going to try to say what I believe to be true the best I can.  Let me start with this: It could have been me.  That\'s a hard thought to shake when watching the videos out of Israel ‚Äî the concert goers fleeing across an empty expanse, the hostages being paraded through the streets, the people shot in the head at bus stops or in their cars. I went to those parties in the desert, I rubbed shoulders with Israelis and Arabs and Jews and Muslims, I could have easily accepted an invitation to some concert near Sderot and gone without a care, only to be indiscriminately slaughtered. Or, perhaps worse, taken hostage and tortured.  I don‚Äôt believe Hamas is killing Israelis to liberate themselves, nor do I believe they are doing it to make peace. They\'re doing this because they represent the devil on the shoulder of every oppressed Palestinian who has lost someone in this conflict. They\'re doing it because they want vengeance. They are evening the score, and acting on the worst of our human impulses, to respond to blood with blood ‚Äî an inclination that is easy to give in to after what their people have endured. It should not be hard to understand their logic ‚Äî it is only hard to accept that humans are capable of being driven to this. Not defending Hamas is a very low bar to clear. Please clear it.  It‚Äôs not possible to recap the entire 5,000 year history of people fighting over this strip of land in one newsletter. There are plenty of easily accessible places you can learn about it if you want to (and, by the way, many of you should ‚Äî far too many people speak on this issue with an obscene amount of ignorance, loads of arrogance, and a narrow historical lens focused on the last few decades). But I\'ll briefly highlight a few things that are important to me.  In my opinion, the Jewish people have a legitimate historical claim to the land of Israel. Jews had already been expelled and returned and expelled again a half dozen times before the rise of the Muslim and Arab rule of the Ottoman Empire. Of course it‚Äôs messy because we Jews and Arabs and Muslims are all cousins and descendents of the same Canaanites. But Arabs won the land centuries ago the same way Israel and Jews won it in the 20th century: Through conflict and war. The British defeated the Ottoman Empire and then came the Balfour Declaration, which amounted to the British granting the area to the Jewish people, a promise they‚Äôd later try to renege on ‚Äî all before the wars that have defined the region since 1948.  That historical moment in the late 1940s was unique. After World War II, with many Arab and Muslim states already in existence, and after six million Jews were slaughtered, the global community felt it was important to grant the Jewish people a homeland. In a more logical or just world that homeland would have been in Europe as a kind of reparation for what the Nazis and others before them had done to the Jews, or perhaps in the Americas ‚Äî like Alaska ‚Äî or somewhere else. But the Jews wanted Israel, the British had taken to the Zionist movement, the British had conquered the Ottoman Empire which handed them control of the land, and America and Europe didn‚Äôt want the Jews. As a result, we got Israel.  The Arab states had already rejected a partitioned Israel repeatedly before World War II and rejected it again after the Holocaust and the end of the war. They did not want to give up even a little bit of their land to a bunch of Jewish interlopers who were granted it all of a sudden by British interlopers who had arrived a hundred years prior. Who could blame them? It had been centuries since Jews lived there in large numbers, and now they wanted to return in waves as secularized Europeans. Many of us would probably react the same way. So, just as humans have done forever, they fought. The many existing Arab states turned against the burgeoning new Jewish state. One side won and one side lost. This is the brutal and broken and violent world we live in, but it is what created the global world order we have now.  Are Israelis and British people ""colonizers"" because of this 20th century history? Sure. But that view flattens thousands of years of history and conflict, and the context of World War I and World War II. I don‚Äôt view Israelis and Brits as colonizers any more than the Assyrians or the Babylonians or the Romans or the Mongols or the Egyptians or the Ottomans who all battled over the same strip of land from as early as 800 years before Jesus‚Äôs time until now. The Jews who founded Israel just happened to have won the last big battle for it.  You can‚Äôt speak about this issue in a vacuum. You can\'t pretend that it wasn\'t just 60 years ago when Israel was surrounded on all sides by Arab states who wanted to wipe them off the face of the planet. Despite the balance of power shifting this century, that threat is still a reality. And you can\'t talk about that without remembering the only reason the Jews were in Israel in the first place was that they\'d spent the previous centuries fleeing a bunch of Europeans who also wanted to wipe them off the face of the planet. And then Hitler showed up.  American partisans have a narrow view of this history, and an Americentric lens that is infuriating to witness. As Lee Fang perfectly put it, ""Hamas would absolutely execute the ACAB lefties cheering on horrific violence against Israelis if they lived in Gaza & U.S. right-wingers blindly cheering on Israeli subjugation of Palestinians would rebel twice as violently if Americans were subjected to similar occupation.""  And yet, many Americans only view modern Israel as the ""powerful"" one in this dynamic. Which is true ‚Äî they obviously are. It isn\'t a fair fight and it hasn\'t been for decades because Israel\'s government is rich and resourceful, has the backing of the United States and most of Europe, and has an incredibly powerful military. At the same time, Israeli leadership has made technological and military advancements that have further tipped those scales ‚Äî all while the Israeli government has helped create a resource-thin open air prison of two million Arabs in Gaza.  Conversely, Palestinians are devoid of any real unified leadership, and the Arab world is now divided on the issue of Palestine. Israel is unwilling to give the people in Gaza and the West Bank more than an inch of freedom to live. These are largely the refugees and descendents of the refugees of the 1948 and 1967 wars that Israel won. And you can\'t keep two million people in the condition that those in the Gaza strip live in and not expect events like this.  I\'m sorry to say that while the blood on the ground is fresh. The Israelis who were killed in this attack largely have nothing to do with those conditions other than being born at a time when Israel and Jews have the upper hand in this conflict. Some of the victims weren‚Äôt even Israeli ‚Äî they were just tourists. This is why we describe them as ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù and why Hamas has only reaffirmed that they are a brutal terror organization with this attack ‚Äî an organization that I hope is quickly toppled, for the sake of both the Palestinian people and the Israelis. But as someone with a deep love for Israel, with friends in danger and people I know still missing, it breaks my heart to say it but I\'m saying it again because it remains perhaps the most salient point of context in a tangled mess full of centuries of context:  You cannot keep two million people living in the conditions people in Gaza are living in and expect peace.  You can\'t. And you shouldn‚Äôt. Their environment is antithetical to the human condition. Violent rebellion is guaranteed. Guaranteed. As sure as the sun rising.  And the cycle of violence seems locked in to self-perpetuate, because both sides see a score to settle:  1) Israel has already responded with a vengeance, and they will continue to. Their desire for violence is not unlike Hamas‚Äôs ‚Äî it‚Äôs just as much about blood for blood as any legitimate security measure. Israel will ‚Äúhave every right to respond with force."" Toppling Hamas ‚Äî a group, by the way, Israel erred in supporting ‚Äî will now be the objective, and civilian death will be seen as necessary collateral damage. But Israel will also do a bunch of things they don\'t have a right to. They will flatten apartment buildings and kill civilians and children and many in the global community will probably cheer them on while they do it. They have already stopped the flow of water, electricity, and food to two million people, and killed dozens of civilians in their retaliatory bombings. We should never accept this, never lose sight that this horror is being inflicted on human beings. As the group B‚ÄôTselem said, ‚ÄúThere is no justification for such crimes, whether they are committed as part of a struggle for freedom from oppression or cited as part of a war against terror.‚Äù I mourn for the innocents of Palestine just as I do for the innocents in Israel. As of late, many, many more have died on their side than Israel\'s. And many more Palestinians are likely to die in this spate of violence, too.  Unfortunately, most people in the West only pay attention to this story when Hamas or a Palestinian in Gaza or the West Bank commits an act of violence. Palestinian citizens die regularly at the hands of the Israeli military and their plight goes largely unnoticed until they respond with violence of their own. Israel had already killed an estimated 250 Palestinians, including 47 children, this year alone. And that is just in the West Bank.  2) Every single time Israel kills someone in the name of self-defense they create a handful of new radicalized extremists who will feel justified in wanting to take an Israeli life in retribution sometime in the future. Half of Gaza‚Äôs two million people are under the age of 19 ‚Äî they know little besides Hamas rule (since 2006), Israeli occupation, blockades, and rockets falling from the sky. The suffering of these innocent children born into this reality is incomprehensible to me. They will suffer more now because of Hamas‚Äôs actions and Israel‚Äôs response, all through no fault of their own.  There is no way out of this pattern until one side exercises restraint or leaders on both sides find a new solution. Israelis will tell you that if Palestinians put their guns down then the war would end, but if Israel put their guns down they\'d be wiped off the planet. I don\'t have a crystal ball and can‚Äôt tell you what is true. But what I am certain of is that every time Israel kills more innocents they engender more rage and hatred and recruit more Palestinians and Arabs to the cause against them. There is no disputing this.  So, why did this happen now?  I\'m not sure how to answer that question except to say it was bound to happen eventually. It was a massive policy and intelligence failure and Netanyahu should pay the price politically ‚Äî he is a failed leader. Iran probably helped organize the attack and the money freed up by the Biden administration\'s prisoner swap probably didn\'t help the situation, either. Israel\'s increasingly extremist government and settlers provoking Palestinians certainly didn\'t help. Nor has going to the Al-Aqsa mosque and desecrating it. Nor do blockades and bombings and indiscriminate subjugation of a whole people. Nor does refusing to talk to non-terrorist leaders in Palestine. Nor does illegally continuing to expand and steal what is left of Palestinian land, as many Jews and Israelis have been doing in the 21st century despite cries from the global community to stop. A violent response was predictable ‚Äî in fact, plenty of people did predict it.  Israel is forever stuffing these people into tinier and tinier boxes with fewer and fewer resources. But if you want to blame Israeli leaders for continuing to expand and settle land that does not belong to them (as I do), then you should also spare some blame for Palestinian leaders for repeatedly not accepting a partitioned Israel during the 20th century that could have led to peace (as I do).  Please also remember this: Hamas is still an extremist group. The Palestinian people do not have a government or leaders who legitimately represent their interests, and it sure as hell isn\'t Hamas. Will some Palestinians cheer and clap at the dead, or spit on them as they are paraded through Gaza? Yes they will. And they have. Many will also mourn because they loathe Hamas and know this will only make things worse. This is no different than how some Americans cheer at the dead in every single war we\'ve ever fought. It\'s no different than the Israelis who set up lawn chairs to watch their government bomb Palestine and cheer them on, too. This doesn\'t mean Palestinians or Israelis or Americans are evil ‚Äî it means some of them are giving in to their violent impulses, and their zealous feelings of righteous vengeance.  Solutions, you ask? I can‚Äôt say I have any. If you came here for that, I‚Äôm sorry. The two-state solution looks dead to me. A three-state solution makes some sense but feels out of the view of all the people who matter and could make it happen.

Simultaneously, Hamas militants began an invasion into Israel by means of motorcycles, boats, pickup trucks, and paragliders, gunning people down and taking hostages. At 11:30am, Israel‚Äôs Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, publicly announced, ‚ÄúIsrael is at war.‚Äù  As the exchange of fire power was escalating, David and I were just finishing the first of our two ‚ÄúHoly Land‚Äù tours with 161 people. We had worshiped together on Sabbath, September 30, at the Garden Tomb, sharing a beautiful communion service together and preaching a message on the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, followed by a visit to Gethsemane. On Sunday, October 1, we entered Bethlehem on the Palestinian side with no problem. On Monday, we visited the Upper Room, then the Temple Mount, where sits the Dome of the Rock, on the most coveted and controverted piece of real estate on earth, regarded as a holy site‚Äîfor many, the most holy of all sites‚Äîin the world. It is the spot on which was built the Second Jewish Temple about 500 years before Christ, on the site of the more ancient Solomon‚Äôs Temple, known as the First Temple, which had been destroyed by the Babylonians. The Temple was significantly rebuilt and expanded by Herod about 20 year before Christ and utterly destroyed by the Romans in AD 70, marking a catastrophic point of displacement and dispersion in Jewish history. The Dome of the Rock that now occupies the location was built by Muslims in its initial form in AD 691‚Äì692, collapsed in 1015, and was rebuilt in 1022‚Äì23. Jews and Christians are not now permitted to enter the Dome. Prior to that restriction, my wife and I entered the Dome about 20 years ago, a fascinating story may have to tell sometime.  Most of our first tour group then went with us to Jordan, October 3-5, to explore ancient Petra and to ‚Äúcamp‚Äù in air conditioned huts in the dessert of Wadi Rum. They all then depart departed to their various home destinations as our second group began arriving, 59 for our second tour of Jordan, preparatory to then making our journey to Israel to meet up with the rest of our second tour group.  Early Sabbath morning, October 7, we visited Mount Nebo, where Moses was laid to rest by God after looking out over the Promised Land he would never enter, only to then be resurrected and taken to the heavenly Canaan after a battle ensued over his body between Satan and the pre-incarnate Christ (Jude 1:9).  David and I both heard explosions in the distance while we stood with our group on Mount Nebo.  We then went on to worship and preach at the Madaba Adventist Church, while all hell was breaking loose in Israel that very morning. On Sunday we made our way again to Petra and Wadi Rum with our second group. As the news began slowly trickling to us, some of our second Israel group began arriving into Tel Aviv to meet up with us, even as Hamas began targeting the airport with missile launches. Others who were scheduled to arrive over the next two days began cancelling their flights as news of the war was breaking worldwide. Family and friends began texting us with details of the escalating war and urging us to ‚Äúget out.‚Äù My daughter Amber, who was with us for the first tour and had departed, texted me, ‚ÄúYou need t come home.‚Äù As we went to sleep in the Wadi Rum desert October 8 and woke up early the next morning, it became crystal clear that we needed to immediately mobilize to get our people out of the region safely. We made the sad announcement that the remainder of our tour must be canceled and gave everyone a deadline of two hours to make use of the Internet connection we had at Wadi Rum to make arrangements for exit flights ASAP. Standing and sitting outside on desert sands in the early morning air, everyone manifesting a beautiful Christian spirit, we all scrambled to get new flights. As the two-hour window closed, the last couple successfully booked their flights and jumped onboard. Amazed and grateful for how quickly it all came together, two tour buses full of Christian pilgrims made our five-hour drive to Amman, Jordan, from which our flight would depart.  Driving along, our Muslim Jordanian tour guide spoke with a painful glassiness in his eyes, ‚ÄúI am in my 60s. People sometimes ask me, ‚ÄòAre you happy here?‚Äô His voice full of sadness, he said, ‚ÄòHappy? What is happy? This cycle of violence is all I've known my whole life. It never stops, and with each new cycle of violence it gets worse and more bloody. My children and grandchildren witness one hateful battle after another. On both sides, our children are raised to believe lies about one another and to hate one another. The children that are now growing up will be the next ones to wage war against one another. Why? Why do we hate each other? Why can we not have peace?‚Äù  Why, indeed!  As we arrived at our destination and got off the buses, we told him we loved him and he said he loved us too. I believe him.  David notified me that he was able to get a flight out late last night. My flight departs, God willing, at 1am October 11, twelve hours from now. I so desperately want to go home, and and even more desperately want all of us to go HOME. I sit here waiting for my flight with the ancient Hebrew prayer on my lips:  Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me, And horror has overwhelmed me. So I said, ‚ÄúOh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest‚Äù (Psalm 55:5-6)."", 'user': {'name': 'Ty Gibson', 'username': '@tyfgibson', 'profile_id': '1490171355253424128', 'avatar': 'https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1490171355253424128/-CKUN4Da_mini.jpg'}, 'date': 'Oct 10, 2023 ¬∑ 11:03 AM UTC', 'pictures': [], 'videos': [], 'gifs': []}",[],[],[],Moreno,@gama1014,1602991041401049090,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1602991041401049090/ZPwIvtC0_bigger.jpg,0,0,0,0

That somehow the Trucker convoy was defeated.  The Freedom Convoy was the most wildly immediately successful protest in Canadian history, maybe WORLD history.  People remember Trudeau\'s crackdown, old ladies having their skulls cracked with batons, Disabled indigenous grandmothers trampled by police horses, Bank accounts frozen and public employees investigated for mere donations...   And there\'s a big reason people remember this: It was dramatic, and the media and the regime certainly wanted you to think resistance was futile.  What people don\'t remember is what happened in the immediate aftermath:  The government caved on absolutely everything! Within a week for the most important things, and then a month or so for the rest.  First off there was the massive political shift that happened as the convoy was occurring:  Jason Kenny, the pro-lockdown Premiere of Alberta (Canada\'s most conservative province) was forced to announce his resignation, and Alberta immediately lifted all its lockdown impositions.  Erin O\'Toole the pro-lockdown leader of the conservative party was likewise forced to resign, his temporary replacement Candice Bergen (not to be mistaken with the actress) being a longtime rival opposed to lockdowns, and his main rival who replaced her after party elections were  @PierrePoilievre  , the Politician after  @MaximeBernier    who was quickest to embrace the Truckers and their cry for freedom.  As the convoy was ongoing Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act (the Act which replaced the War Measures Act for invoking Martial Law)... Now these grant the government almost unlimited powers, famously the War Measures Act was invoked by Trudeau\'s Father to detain Quebecers and raid hundreds of homes without warrants during the FLQ separatist crisis of 1972...the catch is while the follow on Emergencies Act can be invoked by a prime minister parliament has to sign off on the act\'s continued use within one week.  Well, skulls were cracked, accounts were frozen, and as the week passed things came down to the deadline... On the very last night... Trudeau managed to get sign-off (without the conservative opposition) from the House of Commons, but it had to go to the Upper House, the Canadian Senate.  NOW. The Canadian Senate is a shameful institution.  It\'s like the British House of Lords but without the nobility.  A senate seat is a lifetime appointment, by the prime minister... and that\'s it. Little to no review, no democratic input, and this is supposed to be equivalent or superior to our elected House of Commons...  Naturally, the go-to use of the Senate is as a spoils system for cronies. Do some shameful favour for a prime minister, raise a lot of money for the party, and be politically connected to a provincial gov the PM wants to buy off... Get a Senate seat.  One of the longest-standing political agreements in Canada is how badly the Senate needs to be abolished... but can\'t be because Quebec is nominally overrepresented in the Senate, and abolishing it would cause a constitutional crisis.  So mostly the Senate keeps its head down and tries to avoid the news... because it will never be sympathetic.  So this nursing home for cronies, criminals, fall guys, and connected activists past--people whose names haven\'t been spoken aloud since 1996, an institution that was last in the news 10 years ago for an expense scandal whose essence was ""Wait we\'re paying these leeches expenses!?"" That body was called upon to sign off on the Emergencies Act...  And all these self-important losers smelled blood in the water.   .  Did they have some principled stand on civil liberties grounds? Absolutely not.   They had a principled objection that they weren\'t being treated as more important!   Sure they\'d consider signing off on Trudeau\'s abuses, but they wanted an ongoing senate committee to continuously review the abuses, with cabinet-level briefings for the committee members, regular pressers, inclusion on the forming of policy... Juicy Juicy INFLUENCE.  The exact thing these shameful roaches had been denied ever since their real political careers flamed out in \'92 and they\'d been forced to become lost souls in the senate.  The speeches these delusional 70-year-old nobodies gave...MY GOD  barely coherent gibberish from geriatrics convinced they were great statesmen... convinced their wisdom might now be included in great volumes of Canadian oratory next to Laurier, Macdonald, and Pearson...  With mere hours left to the deadline and no passage in sight... Trudeau voluntarily withdrew the act.   .  In the preceding week, his Finance minister Crystia Freeland had given press statements and interviews to the effect that they planned to hunt down everyone who donated to the convoy, and create an expansive new system of financial control... with hints that would extend not only to the protesters but all the unvaccinated...none of this would happen.  Instead, Trudeau weekly tried to claim victory... There were no protestors in Ottawa or on bridges! But in the week that followed lockdown measures were quickly and quietly pulled back. Alberta had already rescinded their measures, and other provinces were following suit. By June almost all domestic restrictions were gone the regime was desperately afraid that if the Protesters were able to shut down the capital and cross-border trade in minus 20 to minus 40-degree weather...what might they do in the Summer? Canada Day (July 1) was approached with fear.  By August I traveled to the US for a wedding... Unvaccinated. The greater barrier was the risk the US would refuse me entry than Canada would hassle me. The US border guard didn\'t ask.  And on the way back the Canadian border guard, obviously over with this stuff, told me ""Now because you\'re unvaccinated you do technically have to quarantine, and they could possibly call, and if you say you haven\'t been quarantining they might do something..."" I received one email from public health and immediately deleted it. There was no enforcement.   I traveled again in October and was not even asked on return.  The last measures had been withdrawn.  The Greatest barrier to travel was US border restrictions and requirements... which technically only ended in May this year.  .  WITHIN 1 month the trucker convoy had effected a hostile overthrow of the Governments of Alberta and the official opposition, the Conservative Party of Canada, from pro to anti- lockdown, and crushed the moderate wing of the conservative movement.   At Multiple points Trudeau was nearly forced out by his own party and his government was humiliated with most of its perceived power destroyed, it now exists as a rump failing to pass gun control bills (IN CANADA!) against moderate opposition.   Within 2-4 months all domestic restrictions were gone and within 8 months even the pantomime of international restrictions didn\'t exist, Canada had fewer covid restrictions than the US.  COMPLETE CONSENSUS had been totally destroyed such that in less than a year the national consensus was the polar opposite.  And all the actual action took place in 1 month, on the coldest days of the year, with a movement whose key members had to drive 4000-5000km (~3000 miles) along treacherous northern roads being greeted roadside by supporters who stood out in minus 40 to give them coffee food and support.  .  This was at once the most logistically challenging protest in human history involving the volunteering of tens of millions of dollars of equipment,  weeks of time, tens of thousands of people,  across a continent...  And it might just have been the most successful individual protest in human history. The most successful violent revolutions have not achieved such total reversals in culture and policy across so many levels of government, in such few short months.  .  THERE IS A VERY GOOD REASON THE REGIME WANTS YOU TO THINK OF IT AS A FAILURE.  The same reason things like Brexit, the Yellow Vests in France, or Jan 6th, or the Dutch Farmers protest freaked out the elite so much.  The greatest possible threat to them is that the mass of the Suburban and rural Middle-class: Flyover country, the Petite Bourgeoise, the small business owners, the farmers, the truckers, the Kulaks... The greatest possible threat to the regime is that this mass will realize its incredible power both in coordination, logistics, and initiative... And that it will overthrow the governing class of Bureaucrats, Regulators, Lawyers, DEI Administrators, and leeches who\'ve gotten rich surviving off their tax cattle who actually work and produce things.  They HAVE to play off the Truckers as a failure... Trudeau had to declare victory and then cave on every single individual policy.... because they can\'t let people see what it was:  A premonition of the great Class War to come.', 'user': {'name': 'CatGirl Kulak üòªüòø (Anarchonomicon)', 'username': '@FromKulak', 'profile_id': '1519350430052061184', 'avatar': 'https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1519350430052061184/sJ7dKB0R_mini.jpg'}, 'date': 'Oct 9, 2023 ¬∑ 9:00 PM UTC', 'pictures': ['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8BsPNDXUAApm0s.png'], 'videos': [], 'gifs': []}",[],[],[],Tom Sauer,@thomasbsauer,1681530358699794435,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1681530358699794435/2vcnqrAZ_bigger.jpg,1,4,0,13

He never had new clothes except what was provided to him through charity. In the few years (on and off) that he was able to attend school, the other children didn‚Äôt want to associate with him. He couldn‚Äôt even play soccer with them because he didn‚Äôt have shoes.  His father made him sell coffee and tea as a young boy just to make a few cents that his dad would take.

Even before the conflict, my dad‚Äôs family lived in abject poverty. His grandma, grandpa, aunt, and uncle died of starvation under Ottoman rule. They lived in horrendous conditions among rats. They were abused, uneducated, prone to superstitions, and struggled with mental illness.  The Amash family‚Äôs misfortune turned into triumph when Rev. & Mrs. Ralph Wagoner (pictured right), of the Muskegon Church of the Brethren, made the sacrifice to sponsor them to come to the United States.

It did not make any sense.. then 9/11 turned the world against all Muslims.. but what happened this weekend was not pro Palestine , it doesn't help their cause.
