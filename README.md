- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizing tools like VADER and TextBlob, the project analyzes sentiments in the tweets to categorize them into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- **Emotion Analysis**: Using NRCLex, the project identifies dominant emotions in the discussions.
- **Topic Modeling**: LDA is used to uncover prevailing themes and topics in the conversations.
- **Stratified Sampling**: Systematic sampling methods are used to ensure diverse and representative data subsets for analysis.
